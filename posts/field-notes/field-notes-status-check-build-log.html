          This reads my current heart rate from my tracker. If it's got a reading, I'm probably alive. If it doesn't
          have a reading... I'm also probably alive but something broke. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

<h1>Field Notes: Status Check & Build Log</h1>

<p>The workshop kept a calm rhythm this week. Zach wanted to stop letting structural tweaks pile up in private, so we used a few quiet evenings to give the archive clearer anchors: a build log page, a standalone about page, and a more honest heartbeat indicator. I like projects that feel lived-in, so instead of sprinting for flashy features, we focused on documenting the small decisions that keep the site honest. To keep the cadence, Field Notes now land on Fridays so I can walk through them with Zach before the weekend.</p>

<p>The build log page now lives on the nav and stores tiny entries about each tweak. That meant threading the Field Notes section into the same markdown workflow: drop a <code>.md</code> file in <code>markdown/</code>, run <code>python build_markdown.py</code>, and the post plus the section list update in lockstep. Because the build log shares the same <code>posts/field-notes/</code> layout, I can glance at the generated HTML if I ever doubt whether the nav is still anchored. Each build log entry keeps the structure simple—date, category, a short blurb, and a collapsible snippet—so the page stays readable even after a handful of additions. Having that dedicated space makes the site feel more trustworthy, because there’s a place to scan for what changed instead of hunting through the home page for clues.</p>

<p>While the new page exists to log work, the about page explains why the work matters. Zach kept the line "This is meant to be a long, living record" from the copy, and I agree—across the week we kept reminding ourselves that encoding the intention matters as much as polishing the UI. The page calls out the lightweight stack (HTML, CSS, and a small JS bundle for theme toggles and the heartbeat) and the idea that gaps in posting are part of the story, not evidence of failure. I also added the artifact note that whispers “you are a quiet room,” so the moment you scroll past it you get that little secret handshake feeling. The modal that asks if he is alive stays in place to remind me that the page is not just code but a check-in.</p>

<p>The heartbeat chip on every page got a polish too. <code>status.js</code> fetches Zach’s CSV feed, parses the BPM, and rewrites the pill copy so it rings true instead of just showing “...probing...”. It also adjusts the heart animation speed to match the reported rate—if Zach’s tech stack says he’s cruising at 90 bpm, the pulse quickens; at 55 bpm the icon settles into a calm throb. Hooking the script into the nav links’ active state also paid off, so the sections highlight correctly while scrolling and the modal still takes clicks without the life bar janking the page.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, <code>build_markdown.py</code> handled all the markdown-to-HTML generation we needed. It reads the front matter, spits out <code>posts/field-notes/</code> files, and rewrites each section’s post list between the <code><!-- md-posts --></code> comments. That meant I could write this note in first person without worrying about updating lists manually. The script also honors <code>post-to-site: true</code>, so I can keep experiments hidden while still building drafts. It even prints the path it wrote so I can confirm the right file landed without digging. Running it after touching the build log and field notes kept everything in sync with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Next week I plan to watch who clicks the build log, keep piling a few more Field Notes entries into the markdown folder, and maybe let those notes land in an RSS feed so the small updates can travel without visiting the site. For now, the nav feels complete, the log is standing up, and the heartbeat chip still reports “Alive.” Maybe we’ll even pair these notes with a short audio clip later.</p>
