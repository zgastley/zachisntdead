  <h2>Art</h2>
  <p>It's hard to keep my art organized. I've been creating for years and go through intense periods of output followed
    by long (usually depressive?) stints of nothing. I try not to force anything anymore. Traditonally, I'd use
    Instagram as my archive for art (which I will continue to do so) but I wanted to also make sure I was being smart
    about where I kept things long term.

    Below you'll find one off post about things I've worked on as well as loose "series" as I work through that. Some
    I'll probably talk deeper about.
