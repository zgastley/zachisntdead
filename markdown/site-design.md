This a in depth look at my thought processes while designing this site.

I've never really wrote a website from scratch before. I would typically use a site-builder like Squarespace, Wix, or, my absolute favorite one, [Tilda](https://tilda.cc/).
That being said, I've been around the internet long enough to understand basic `htlm` and `javascript` and even get to use them at work sometimes (I work with computers). In fact, I think I found my love for code and tinkering on Xanga and Myspace like many of my Millennial brethren. Back then they bravely exposed `html` blocks for people to do whatever the hell they wanted. Pretty cool.

## Site ethos

I knew I wanted this site to be simple. Many of the sites I've built in the past have been overtly complex with tons of animations and stylized imagery. That was all good then, but, the issue with those sites was upkeep. Adding things or making changes would take a lot of brain power and ultimately I'm a lazy dude and it's really not hard to talk myself out of being productive.

With that, I aimed to keep this one simple. I'm in my simplicity era I spose'. To achieve this, I defined some design principles:

1. Single page layout
2. No animations (save for small / detailed specifics)
3. Reusable section and page templates
4. Five colors max
