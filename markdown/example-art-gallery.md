A loose series built from small visual field notes. Each panel is a quick capture: texture, line, and whatever kept catching my eye that week.

## Process

Working fast keeps the marks honest. I scan everything, clean the edges just enough, and let the artifacts stay.

## Materials

Graphite, ink, found paper. Messy edges are part of the point.
